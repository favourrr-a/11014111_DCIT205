                <p>
                    This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science. The study of computer science is therefore
                    critical if society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid economic 
                    advances. Computer science involves the study and development of applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, 
                    the software systems that support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both applications and systems 
                    that behave reliably, correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming and
                    employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the 
                    ability to apply sound engineering principles to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them to find employment in 
                    many diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working in a project team (or 
                    research and development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to that team. The course also provides
                    the platform for further study or research through exposure to established and emerging technologies and methods, and to active
                    fields of research in Computer Science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, 
                    Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and 
                    Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
